📌 SkillMirror – GitHub Skill Analyzer

  SkillMirror is a web application that analyzes a user’s public GitHub repositories and displays their actual technical skills using real data and visual charts.
  Instead of assuming skills from resumes, SkillMirror shows proof-based skills derived from GitHub activity.



🎯 Why I Built This Project

  Many people mention skills in their resumes without real evidence.
  
  I built SkillMirror to:
  
  1. Validate skills using real GitHub work.
     
  2. Avoid assumptions and show data-driven results.
     
  3. Help recruiters and learners understand actual skill usage.



🧠 How It Works

    1. User enters a GitHub username
      
    2.App fetches public repositories using GitHub API
   
    3.Programming languages are analyzed from repos
   
    4.Skills are categorized and counted
   
    5.Results are displayed using interactive charts
